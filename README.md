# Crud-example

a CRUD example using Golang's Echo framework

# Goal

I wrote this repo, not to practice CRUD on golang, but to test out new frameworks and best practices in setting development environment.

Goal of this repo is to find a definitive good practice to setup development environment for Golang.

I will write a summary on Medium on this very topic once the investigation is finished.

# List of tools which I have investigated:

### Go Libraries / Tool

-  [X] VGo vs Go Dep vs Glide
-  [X] Echo Framework and Middlewares
-  [X] Swaggo Swagger (and for Echo/Swagger middleware)
-  [X] Fresh vs Realize
-  [ ] Pre-commit, pre-push git hook
-  [ ] gRPC and gRPC eco-system (to be done in a different repo)

### Dev Ops

-  [X] Docker, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm
-  [X] Kubernetes(k8s) and Minikube
-  [X] Skaffold and Helm
-  [ ] Gitlab CD/CI
